# reticle.ts

## Purpose

The hit-test reticle for the minimal GPS + AR example — a faithful port of the
reticle from the stock three.js `webxr_ar_hittest` example. It is the small,
deterministic "reticle view-model": given the latest hit-test pose (a
column-major 4×4 transform) or `null`, it drives a Three.js mesh's visibility +
transform.

The per-frame XR plumbing (requesting the hit-test source, reading
`frame.getHitTestResults(...)`) lives in [main.ts](main.ts); only the logic
here is unit-tested because it is what a porting developer is most likely to get
subtly wrong.

## Public API

- `type HitMatrix = Float32Array | number[]` — a column-major 16-element
  transform, as produced by `XRPose.transform.matrix`.
- `createReticleMesh(): Mesh` — builds a thin ring laid flat in the XZ plane.
  Returns a mesh with `matrixAutoUpdate = false` and `visible = false`.
- `updateReticle(reticle: Object3D, matrix: HitMatrix | null): void` — applies
  the pose:
  - non-null 16-element matrix → reticle adopts it verbatim and becomes visible;
  - `null` → reticle is hidden.

## Invariants & assumptions

- `matrixAutoUpdate` **must** stay `false` on the reticle: the world transform
  is written wholesale from the hit pose each frame, so letting Three.js
  recompose it from position/quaternion/scale would discard the pose.
- The mesh is parented under `getArWorldGroup()` (AR-local space) by the caller,
  **not** the GPS-aligned scene root — see [main.ts.md](main.ts.md) delta #2.
- `updateReticle` operates on any `Object3D`, so it is testable without a WebGL
  context. It does not validate matrix length; callers pass the 16-element
  `XRPose.transform.matrix`.

## Examples

```ts
const reticle = createReticleMesh();
arWorldGroup.add(reticle);
// each XR frame:
updateReticle(reticle, hitPose ? hitPose.transform.matrix : null);
```

## Tests

[reticle.test.ts](reticle.test.ts) — pins: the mesh starts hidden with manual
matrix updates; a hit pose makes it visible and is adopted verbatim (including a
`Float32Array` pose); a `null` hit hides it (no stale reticle).
