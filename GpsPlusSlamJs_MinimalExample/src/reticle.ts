/**
 * Hit-test reticle for the minimal GPS+AR example.
 *
 * This is a faithful port of the reticle from the stock three.js
 * `webxr_ar_hittest` example: a flat ring laid on whatever real-world surface
 * the WebXR `hit-test` API reports under the screen centre. The only framework
 * delta is *where* the mesh is parented — see the example's `main.ts`, which
 * adds it under `getArWorldGroup()` (AR-local space) rather than the GPS-aligned
 * scene root (Finding 2 in the plan doc).
 *
 * The per-frame XR plumbing (requesting the hit-test source, reading
 * `frame.getHitTestResults(...)`) lives in `main.ts` and is verified manually
 * on-device. The two functions here are the small, deterministic
 * "reticle view-model": given the latest hit pose (a column-major 4x4 transform
 * matrix) or `null`, drive the mesh's visibility + transform. They are unit
 * tested in `reticle.test.ts` because that is the logic a porting developer is
 * most likely to get subtly wrong (e.g. forgetting to hide the reticle when no
 * surface is found, or letting Three.js overwrite the matrix).
