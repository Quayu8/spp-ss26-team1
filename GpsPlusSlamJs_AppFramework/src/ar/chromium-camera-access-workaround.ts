/**
 * Chromium WebXR camera-access tab-crash workaround.
 *
 * Background:
 * Requesting `camera-access` as an optional WebXR feature on Android Chrome
 * 147+ causes a fatal renderer-process crash (`CrRendererMain`) 1–2 seconds
 * after entering AR. The crash reproduces in the upstream three.js
 * `webxr_ar_hittest.html` example with `optionalFeatures: ['camera-access']`
 * added — i.e. it is not specific to this app's session setup. See:
 *
 *   - GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-04-22-camera-access-reproducer-plan.md
 *   - GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-04-camera-access-crash-regression-chrome-148.md
 *   - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/33404
 *   - https://issues.chromium.org/issues/507508099 (root-cause, marked Fixed)
 *
 * There is NOT a single crash here — the Chromium tracker notes the crash on
 * Chrome 147 is different from the crash on 148+, and the simple workaround
 * below only helped on a subset of versions. The timeline:
 *
 *   - 147 .. 148.0.7778.early : deleting `createProjectionLayer` / `layers`
 *       forces three.js onto `XRWebGLLayer` and sidesteps the crash.
 *   - 148.0.7778.12 .. 149.0.7821 : the delete-only trick stopped working.
 *       An additional patch is needed: persist the `baseLayer` reference
 *       across `XRSession.prototype.updateRenderState` so three.js's later
 *       `depthNear`/`depthFar` update does not drop the active `glBaseLayer`.
 *   - > 149.0.7821 (incl. Chrome 150+) : Chromium fixed the root cause and
 *       separated the camera-image lifecycle from the active layer. The fix
 *       targets the stock projection-layer path, so on patched Chrome the
 *       workaround is *harmful*: forcing `XRWebGLLayer` re-enters the legacy
 *       path that was never fixed. On patched Chrome we MUST do nothing and
 *       let three.js use its normal projection-layer path.
 *
 * Because of that last point this helper is version-aware: it detects the
 * Chrome build from the user agent and **skips entirely on patched Chrome**.
 * On all other (affected or unknown) environments it behaves like the
 * original delete-based workaround, and additionally applies the
 * baseLayer-persistence patch when a genuinely affected Chrome build is
 * detected.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - This is a Chromium-specific hack and the upstream comment explicitly
 *   warns it "might break webxr on other devices" — keep it opt-in.
 * - Must run BEFORE any WebXR session setup. Three.js reads these prototype
 *   members lazily when the first session starts, so calling this at app
 *   bootstrap (before `initAR()`) is sufficient.
 * - Idempotent: safe to call repeatedly. Safe on environments where the
 *   prototypes do not exist (e.g. desktop browsers, jsdom).
