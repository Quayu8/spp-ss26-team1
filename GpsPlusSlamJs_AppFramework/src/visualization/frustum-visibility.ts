/**
 * Frustum-visibility predicates used by GPS-anchored components and any other
 * caller that needs to know whether a world-space point/sphere/object is
 * currently visible to a camera. Three.js's `Frustum` has the primitives we
 * need; this module wraps them so:
 *
 *  - All three predicates share a module-level scratch `Frustum`/`Matrix4`
 *    so a single frame's worth of checks pays the matrix multiply once.
 *  - Each predicate accepts an optional `frustum` parameter for callers that
 *    already have one built (e.g. via `buildCameraFrustum`) and want to
 *    keep doing many checks against it without rebuilding.
 *
 * The Three.js convention here is that `Frustum.containsPoint` is strict
 * (point must be inside all six planes) while `intersectsSphere`/
 * `intersectsObject` accept overlap with any plane, which is the right
 * notion for "is this object at least partially on screen".

 * next call this function or use one of the predicates without an injected
 * frustum (both reuse the same scratch).
